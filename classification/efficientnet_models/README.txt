Currently, this repository does not provide a pre-trained model for public use due to size constraints and licensing issues. If you are interested in a demonstration of the Ensemble-based Skin Lesion Detection System using a pre-trained model, please follow these steps:

1. Obtain a pre-trained model by contacting the repository maintainers at vhrxksro@gmail.com or marsberry@cu.ac.kr.
2. Place the pre-trained model in the designated directory within the project.
